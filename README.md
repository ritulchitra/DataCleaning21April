# Customer Personality Data Cleaning (Excel)

## Overview

This project involves cleaning the "marketing_campaign.csv" dataset and preparing it for analysis and visualization. The final cleaned file is saved as AICustomerPersonality.xlsx, created with the help of ChatGPT and reviewed by me.

## Cleaning Process

1. Loaded dataset from CSV into Excel.
2. Applied filters to all columns for easier inspection.
3. Removed rows with blank/missing values â€” these were few and didn't impact the overall analysis.
4. **Cleaned categorical column Marital_Status** by removing invalid entries such as "Absurd", "Alone", and "YOLO".Converted date formatat** in the Dt_Customer column using ExceText to Columnsns** feature from the Data tab to ensure proper date formatting.Checked and removed duplicate rowsws** (if any).Verified formats for numeric columnsns** like Income.

## AI-Powered Workflow

The file AICustomerPersonality.xlsx was cleaned using ChatGPT with guidance through prompt engineering. With a basic understanding of prompt structure and task framing, this entire data cleaning process was completed in j5 to 6 minuteses**.

I have also attached screenshots showing how ChatGPT worked on the file step-by-step for complete transparency and reference.

## Output
